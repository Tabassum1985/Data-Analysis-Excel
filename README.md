# ANALYSIS

1. Based on the data that was available we could create a pivot table that analyzes your how many campaigns were successful, failed, canceled, or are currently live per category. When we created a stacked column chart based on the findings, we saw that theater has the maximum number of projects, hence attracts a lot of people and has the maximum number of backers.

2. Turns out based on the pivot table with filter on country we can see US has the maximum number of projects as well as the most successful projects.
