# ANALYSIS

1. Based on the data that was available we could create a pivot table that analyzes your how many campaigns were successful, failed, canceled, or are currently live per category. When we created a stacked column chart based on the findings, we saw that theater has the maximum number of projects, hence attracts a lot of people and has the maximum number of backers.

2. Turns out based on the pivot table with filter on country we can see US has the maximum number of projects as well as the most successful projects.

3. Turns out the year 2017 along with 2019 have seen maximum number of successful projects per parent category:

# LIMITATIONS OF THIS DATASET

According to us the major limitation was that there were no further details on the demographic of the backers, or even which city they were from or even possible income level. In our opinion all this information would help us unleash a deeper connection as to why a backer would feel enticed to fund a specific project.


# RECOMMENDED ADDITIONAL CHART AND GRAPHS

We could have converted all the amount received in different currencies to dollar and then ventured into a pie chart to showcase which country contributed the most dollar amount to a specific project.


# STATISTICAL ANALYSIS

• Use your data to determine whether the mean or the median better summarizes the data:
The median is not as strongly influenced by the skewed values, hence median is more accurate in our opinion particularly for this data set.
• Use your data to determine if there is more variability with successful or unsuccessful campaigns. Does this make sense? Why or why not?
There is more variability in successful campaigns.
